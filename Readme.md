# It looks lie elements are moving horizitally infinitely
- no need javascript 
- only html, css


we create a div 
give position absolute, so that it make an empty space and move with respect to document
move it to the right side 
and using animation move it to left side 
we give each invdividual div a different animation-delay to start it's animation
