/* 

explain 
Assume the total time to perform anuimation is 30s ( To complete one loop it takes 30s)
and we have 8 items to animate. so, each item will take (30 / 8)s  time

now we want sequantial movement of all elements. so, we add unique delay for each item

we make the value negetive by multiplying it withh -1 
if animation-delay property has negetive value that means some part of animation already completed or you can say already running before you visit the webpage. and after that much animation it will continue 

so this is the logic.

Recap :
Duration : 30 / n
Delay : n - x
negative : -1

where, n = total no. of elements
       x = element index number 

*/

/* We can do it mannually without a mathematical formula but it takes time and not as much efficient / beautiful as using mathematics */

/* Open demostrate.html to understand the logic in better way 
A negetive number control from where tha animation start*/



/* If we don't multiplt with -1
then all items are right of the screem starts one by one coming 
but if we multipy with -1 
then all items are on their positin initially and start moving. which looks good as compare to above
